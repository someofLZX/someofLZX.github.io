abstract: The production performance of dairy cattle is closely related to their metabolic state. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the production performance and metabolic features of Sanhe dairy cattle across different parities, with a specific focus on evaluating variations in milk traits and metabolites in both milk and serum. Sanhe dairy cattle from parities 1 to 4 (S1, n = 10; S2, n = 9; S3, n = 10; and S4, n = 10) at mid-lactation were maintained under the same feeding and management conditions. The milk traits, hydrolyzed milk amino acid levels, serum biochemical parameters, and serum free amino acid levels of the Sanhe dairy cattle were determined. Multiparous Sanhe dairy cattle (S2, S3, and S4) had a greater milk protein content, lower milk lactose content, and lower solids-not-fat content than primiparous Sanhe dairy cattle (S1). Moreover, S1 had a higher ratio of essential to total amino acids (EAAs/TAAs) in both the serum and milk. The serum biochemical results showed the lower glucose and total protein levels in S1 cattle were associated with milk quality. Furthermore, ultra-high-resolution high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem MS analysis (UPLC-MS/MS) identified 86 and 105 differential metabolites in the serum and milk, respectively, and these were mainly involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. S1 and S2/S3/S4 had significantly different metabolic patterns in the serum and milk, and more vitamin B-related metabolites were significantly higher identified in S1 than in multiparous cattle. Among 36 shared differential metabolites in the serum and milk, 10 and 7 metabolites were significantly and strongly correlated with differential physiological indices, respectively. The differential metabolites identified were enriched in key metabolic pathways, illustrating the metabolic characteristics of the serum and milk from Sanhe dairy cattle of different parities. L-phenylalanine, dehydroepiandrosterone, and linoleic acid in the milk and N-acetylornithine in the serum could be used as potential marker metabolites to distinguish between Sanhe dairy cattle with parities of 1â€“4. In addition, a metabolic map of the serum and milk from the three aspects of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids was created for the further analysis and exploration of their relationships. These results reveal significant variations in milk traits and metabolites across different parities of Sanhe dairy cattle, highlighting the influence of parity on the metabolic profiles and production performance. Tailored nutritional strategies based on parity-specific metabolic profiles are recommended to optimize milk production and quality in Sanhe cattle.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study elucidates the intricate relationship between the metabolic profile and production performance of Sanhe dairy cattle across different parities. Our findings underscore significant variations in milk traits and metabolites in both the milk and serum, highlighting the influence of parity on dairy cow metabolism. Specifically, multiparous cows exhibited distinct metabolic patterns compared to primiparous ones, with notable differences in milk composition and serum biochemical parameters. The identification of differential metabolites associated with key metabolic pathways provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms influenced by dietary supplementation and parity. Furthermore, the discovery of potential marker metabolites offers promising avenues for distinguishing between cows of different parities. To enhance the production performance of primiparous Sanhe cattle, it is recommended to strengthen the supply of energy and essential amino acids, ensuring optimal milk quality. This study underscores the importance of tailored nutritional strategies based on parity-specific metabolic profiles to optimize milk production and quality in Sanhe dairy cattle, thereby promoting sustainable dairy farming practices.
